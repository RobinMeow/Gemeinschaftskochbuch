# Ui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ToDo

- Look into [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and make some propper unit tests (and e2e tests).
- set up http error handler and message service propperly and implement some (back-end?) logging for errors.
- for more [see requirements](../README.md#requirements)

## Notes

Actually, havnt done anything in the front end, except set up a simple text field with reactive forms (which is to be extended once I finish the actual Domain Model) and implement some neccessary stuff to test and develop. The whole front-end still needs to be designed and created.

> 50% of my Motivation is creating the app so it can solve the "problem" for my family and friends.
> Other 50% is just me wanting to learn whole bunch of up2date technologies I have not touched yet. So I Over-Engineer on purpose, to learn, also I dont wann get stuck in the middle of my project, so I "answer the unkonws early" before I start with the actual development. I might even go so far, and read in automated build pipelines (using Azur or Bitbucket I think? idk, never done, but I feel like the need arises slowly. But it needs to be free of charge :D )

# Ui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ToDo

- Look into [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and make some propper unit tests (and e2e tests).
- set up http error handler and message service propperly and implement some (back-end?) logging for errors.
- for more [see requirements](../README.md#requirements)

## Notes

Actually, havnt done anything in the front end, except set up a simple text field with reactive forms (which is to be extended once I finish the actual Domain Model) and implement some neccessary stuff to test and develop. The whole front-end still needs to be designed and created.
